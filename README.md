This project focuses on audio signal processing, specifically filtering and feature extraction using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). 
It aims to demonstrate how audio signals can be pre-processed and analyzed for tasks such as speech recognition,
music classification, or environmental sound analysis.
